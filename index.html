                From Portland, Maine to Portland, Oregon we're going to take you on an exciting journey through some
                unknown regions of your country. Leave the car at home and travel by bike starting in New England where
                it all began. You will pass through 12 beautiful states, covering a total of 3,600 miles, and accomplish
                3 monumental missions. Partying and taking a selfie with a famous rock star, donating $1 to a
                billionaire to help eradicate polio in Africa, and even stopping by famous author Stephen King's house
                to say hi and asking him to sign your favorite book.</div>

                    highly underrated state full of rich history and majestic natural beauty. Maine is the main state you
                    want to be sure not to miss. As your journey is going to be a long one, you had best be prepared for an
                    arduous trek.<br><br>
                    Thankfully, not only is Maine home to the very first European settlers on US territory in the era of
                    Vikings, but is also home to L.L. Bean, which is a great company to grab a super sturdy backpack from
                    for your 3-month expedition. <br><br>

                    for going down in history. Since the late 1800s Schenectady, “The City that Lights and Hauls the World,”
                    has been home to the world-famous General Electric Company.<br><br>
                    This is where modern power generators were born as well as contemporary means of transmitting energy. So
                    we figured this would be the perfect place to find a batteryless dynamo light for your bicycle to help
                    you see through those dark lonely roads on your adventure. Such a light from GE will set you back about

                    As serene and beautiful as it was in the 1700s, this state is still much less traveled than its
                    neighbors to the South. So enjoy it while it lasts.<br><br>
                    You won't be on your bike the whole time, so doesn't it make sense to pick up some extra footwear?
                    Fortunately for you, the best outdoor shoe company in the history of the world proudly hails from this
                    state. Cycle by the Timberland headquarters in Stratham, and pick up a pair of rugged, waterproof boots
                    to keep your feet dry. Fitting for unpredictable weather you may be confronted by while passing through
                    the Appalachians. These boots are also better than cycling shoes when pitching a tent.<br><br>

                <p class="content_body-noiDung--p">Erie, Pennsylvania, not to be confused with the word “eerie,” although it can be from
                    time to time, is another town worth passing through for several different reasons. While it might be
                    most famously known as the scene of the Gettysburg address delivered by Mr. Lincoln during the Civil
                    war, Pennsylvania also has produced a rather decent-sized Amish community (eerie, huh?)<br><br>
                    The reason we've brought you here today, if you haven't already guessed, can be summed up by using one
                    delicious word: chocolate. Hershey's is a Pennsylvania-based company. Most likely, one of the tastiest
                    missions you'll ever embark on during this tour, try to find an Amish friend and enjoy a bar in the
                    National Wildlife Refuge on your way to Erie and have an extra eerie time!<br><br>
                    The current cost of a Hershey's Chocolate bar: about 60¢.</p>

                    truly hidden gem. Earthquakes are surprisingly common in this particular region of North America, over
                    200 of which have registered with a magnitude of 2 or higher since 1776. However, earthquakes aren't the
                    only thing shaking this centrally located state. One of the country's largest and oldest roller coaster
                    parks is waiting to ROCK your world in Sandusky, Ohio! This will presumably be one of the most thrilling
                    quests you'll ever complete (provided you can stomach it). Take a much-deserved break to ride as many
                    roller coasters as you can before continue your bike ride!<br><br>
